named[6181]: 11-Feb-2011 09:49:56.024 security: warning: client 127.0.0.1#47583: RFC 1918 response from Internet for xx.xx.xx.xx.in-addr.arpa


Resolution
Solution 1
It is necessary to create empty zones for every set of private IP addresses used

An example is shown below:

zone "10.IN-ADDR.ARPA" {  
type master;  
file "empty";  
};

zone "16.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA" {  
type master;  
file "empty";  
};

(..snip..)

zone "31.172.IN-ADDR.ARPA" {  
type master;  
file "empty";  
};

zone "168.192.IN-ADDR.ARPA" {  
type master;  
file "empty";  
};

empty:  
@ 10800 IN SOA . . (  
          1 3600 1200 604800 10800 )  
          @ 10800 IN NS .
          
          
        
        
        
        
Specifically on environments where IPA is setup and it doesn't provide flexibility to add zones manually as above
Bind can automatically create these empty zones by enabling empty-zones-enable yes; in named.conf.
Here is the upstream document
This option works with IPA and normal bind setup
